This is my portfolio page, and sort of tells most things about me. It contains all my projects worth displaying, and since everyone now a days has one of these, I figured why not.

[Oddgson](https://codepen.io/Oddgson/pen/VPrYbv) for the awesome section divider.

To everyone that has supported me in the process of making enough things, that I could justify making this website. I am extremely grateful to you all, My parents, and my amazing teachers and friends. Many projects you see on the site are from like 6 years ago, when I was a kid who knew nothing about nothing. Without ample encouragement of each and everyone involed, this wouldn't have been possible, and they can never be thanked enough.
